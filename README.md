The News Room is a one-of-a-kind app that lets you get all of your news in one place.

As news transitions with the growth of modern technology, many consumers have become overwhelmed or confused with so much content coming at them from so many different directions.

How do you consume news? Is it through Facebook, where you scroll through random posts not knowing what you're looking for? Do you visit individual news sites one at a time?

[The News Room](https://the-news-room-sp.herokuapp.com/) makes your life easy by compiling every news source into one place!

Simply search for the news outlet of your choice, and see their top articles!

## Dev Notes
- As of now, the app serves its purpose without giving unique features to each user. However, new features are being explored to tailor each user's experience to their own desires. 
- Very little data is being stored at the momemt, which may raise the question "Why use a relational database like MySQL?". Some of the features that will be added in the future will benefit from a relational databse, the reason is therefore to avoid technical debt in the future.
